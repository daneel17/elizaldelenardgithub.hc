    <dd style= "font-family: Arial font-size:18px">The introduction of animation techniques in film production such as motion capture, virtual reality, modeling and simulation, has revolutionized <br>
      the entire film industry. We (National Centre for Computer Animation, NCCA) as the No.1 UK research and education base for computer animation, are<br>
       endeavoring to bring these state-of-the-art animation techniques into health industry, benefit more people by improving the efficiency and efficacy<br>
        of healthcare services. Since 1989, the NCCA (winner of the UK – Queen’s Anniversary Prize in 2012), has been at the forefront of computer<br>
         animation education and research in the UK, and our graduates have made a global impact upon the film industry such as the achievement on the <br>
         films of Gravity, Inception and Avatar. We have prioritized multidisciplinary applications of our computer animation technology from film production<br>
          into other fields, especially the Digital health area. In the past five years, we have successfully developed a few medical projects cooperated <br>
          with doctors and local hospitals. For example, “Augury project”: a sophisticated colorectal surgery simulator collaborated with the consultant <br>
          surgeons from Bournemouth & Poole NHS; “Neuravatar”: an intelligent virtual avatar to guide GPs to make neurological diagnosis in their <br>
          clinical practice, guided by Dr. Rupert Page (Consultant Neurologist & Clinical Lead, Dorset Epilepsy Service), funded by AHSN; “Digital Psychiatrist”:<br>
           a facial and emotional recognition system to perform Mental State Examination based on videos and images of patients, collaborated with Dr. Wai Chen <br>
           (Professor of Child Psychiatry at The University of Western Australia).<br></dd>

          <dt style="font-family: Tmes New Roman; font-size:18px"><b>Motion Capture</b></dt>
          <dd style= "font-family: Arial font-size:16px">Motion capture (sometimes referred as mo-cap or mocap, for short) is the process of recording the movement of objects or people. It is used in military,<br>
             entertainment, sports, medical applications, and for validation of computer vision and robotics. </dd>
          <dt style="font-family: Tmes New Roman; font-size:18px"><b>Virtual Reality</b></dt>
          <dd style= "font-family: Arial font-size:16px"> Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated environment with scenes and objects that appear to be real, making the user feel they are immersed in their<br>
             surroundings. This environment is perceived through a device known as a Virtual Reality headset or helmet.
          </dd>
          <dt style="font-family: Tmes New Roman; font-size:18px"><b>System Modeling</b></dt>
          <dd style= "font-family: Arial font-size:16px">System Information Modelling can be defined as the process of digitally modelling a complex connected system. A System Information Model is a shared information <br>
            resource of a system forming a reliable basis of knowledge during its life-cycle. </dd>
          <dt style="font-family: Tmes New Roman; font-size:18px"><b>Simulation</b></dt>
          <dd style= "font-family: Arial font-size:16px"> Simulation is used in many contexts, such as simulation of technology for performance tuning or optimizing, safety engineering, testing, training, education<br>
             and video games. Often, computer experiments are used to study simulation models. Simulation is also used with scientific modelling of natural systems or human<br>
              systems to gain insight into their functioning, as in economics. Simulation can be used to show the eventual real effects of alternative conditions and courses<br>
               of action. Simulation is also used when the real system cannot be engaged, because it may not be accessible, or it may be dangerous or unacceptable to engage, <br>
               or it is being designed but not yet built, or it may simply not exist.</dd>
          <dt style="font-family: Tmes New Roman; font-size:18px"><b>Computer Animation</b></dt>
          <dd style= "font-family: Arial font-size:16px">Computer animation, the branch of computer-generated imagery (CGI) dealing with generating moving digital images, is more in-demand than ever. Special effects<br>
             are an everyday part of modern entertainment, including television shows, movies, and video games. </dd>
          <dt style="font-family: Tmes New Roman; font-size:18px"><b>Healthcare Services</b></dt>
          <dd style= "font-family: Arial font-size:16px">"Health care services" means the furnishing of medicine, medical or surgical treatment, nursing, hospital service, dental service, optometrical service, <br>
            complementary health services or any or all of the enumerated services or any other necessary services of like character, whether or not contingent upon <br>
            sickness or personal injury, as well as the furnishing to any person of any and all other services and goods for the purpose of preventing, alleviating, <br>
            curing or healing human illness, physical disability or injury. </dd>
          <dt style="font-family: Tmes New Roman; font-size:18px"><b>Virtual Intelligence</b></dt>
          <dd style= "font-family: Arial font-size:16px">Virtual intelligence is the term given to artificial intelligence that exists within a virtual world. Many virtual worlds have options for persistent <br>
            avatars that provide information, training, role playing, and social interactions. </dd>
          <dt style="font-family: Tmes New Roman; font-size:18px"><b>Neurological Diagnosis</b></dt>
          <dd style= "font-family: Arial font-size:18px">A neurological examination assesses motor and sensory skills, hearing and speech, vision, coordination, and balance. It may also test mental status, mood,<br>
             and behavior. The examination uses tools such as a tuning fork, flashlight, reflex hammer, and a tool for examining the eye. </dd>
          <dt style="font-family: Tmes New Roman; font-size:18px"><b>Digital Health Area</b></dt>
          <dd style= "font-family: Arial font-size:16px"> Digital health is a simple concept — using technology to help improve individuals' health and wellness — it's a broad and growing sector. It can cover <br>
                                                          everything from wearable gadgets to ingestible sensors, from mobile health apps to artificial intelligence, from robotic carers to electronic records.<br>
                                                           Really it's about applying digital transformation, through disruptive technologies and cultural change, to the healthcare sector.</dd>
          <d style="font-family: Tmes New Roman; font-size:18px"><b>Computer Animation Education</b></dt>
          <dd style= "font-family: Arial font-size: 16px"> An animator's education typically involves a bachelor's degree in computer animation, fine art, or graphic arts. They're expected to be creative and artistic,<br>
             with communication and time management skills. They must also have computer expertise and the ability to use animation and video editing software.<br></dd>
