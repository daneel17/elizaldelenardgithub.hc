<p style="font-family:georgia;">Essential in the Spanish Caribbean and Latin American kitchens, adobo is a savory, all-purpose seasoning that imparts a garlic flavor and is normally used to season and/or marinate meat, chicken, or fish. It is so fundamental in Latin cuisine that adobado means "marinated and cooked in adobo sauce."   <br>
</p>

<h2>INGREDIENTS OF Adobo</h2>

<ul>
  <li>8 chicken thighs, bone-in, skin removed</li>
  <li>150ml/¼ pint dark soy sauce</li>
  <li>4 tbsp sherry or cider vinegar</li>
  <li>2 tbsp light olive oil</li>
  <li>1 tbsp coarsely ground black pepper</li>
  <li>2 tbsp finely grated ginger</li>
  <li>2 tbsp finely grated garlic</li>
  <li>2 bay leaves</li>
  <li>2 large carrots, cut into bite-sized cubes</li>
  <li>400ml/14fl oz chicken stock</li>

<h2>HOW TO COOK BICOL EXPRESS</H2>
<ul>
  <li>1. Place the chicken thighs in a mixing bowl. Mix together the soy sauce, vinegar, 1 tablespoon of the oil, the coarsely ground pepper, half of the grated ginger and half of the grated garlic. Pour this over the chicken and toss to coat well. Cover and marinate in the fridge for 1 hour.</li>
  <li>2. Heat the remaining oil in a wide, non-stick frying pan (that has a lid). Remove the chicken from the marinade (reserving the marinade) and brown the chicken for 3–4 minutes on each side. Transfer to a plate and set aside.</li>
  <li>3. Return the pan to the heat and add the remaining oil, garlic and ginger and stir-fry for 1 minute. Return the chicken to the pan with the reserved marinade, bay leaves, carrots and stock.</li>
  <li>4. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low and allow to simmer for 40 minutes, covering the pan with the lid for the last 15 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.</li>
  <li>5. Meanwhile, cook the rice according to the packet instructions and keep warm.</li>
  <li>6. In a small bowl, mix the cornflour with 2 tablespoons cold water until smooth. Stir the cornflour mixture through the chicken and sauce. Cook for another 4–5 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.</li>
  <li>7. Remove from the heat, sprinkle over the spring onions and serve with the brown rice.</li>
</ul>
